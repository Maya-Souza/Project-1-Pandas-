Cleaning a dataset

#### First thoughts about the data

- Most of the columns have 60% of NaNs. The most affected are 'Age', 'Time' and 'Species', so analysis that take into consideration these data point will not be so precise;  
-  
  
- On the other hand, the 'Date', 'Country' and 'Injury' have a good number of data points to be analysed;
- 
  
- The 'Injury' columns presents a challenge since the injuries are described there, but if a person didn't suffer any injuries it is still registered in text form with no unique standard to all of them. Although, I did notice an interesting pattern of "No injury" written in these cases;
- 
  

#### Possible hypothesis:
- Are you likely to get eaten by a shark? (maybe interactive where you can choose from a set of options and combinations?)
